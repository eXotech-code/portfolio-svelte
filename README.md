# portfolio-svelte

### Motivation

I've always wanted to start my own blog about programming. 
Instead of writing on platforms such as Medium I decided
to start my own portfolio website with a nice looking blog
section since this is a great way to show off my web development
skills in action.

### Technologies

I decided to go with SvelteKit because I like the fact that
the runtime for Svelte-based applications is small and with
SvelteKit it sometimes approaches close to zero JavaScript code
in the more static parts of the webpage. Other than that I just
happen to love writing stuff with Svelte.

TypeScript for me is an obvious choice for anything that has to
communicate with a REST API. I especially like code completion
for accessing object properties.

The back-end is a simple Python + Flask REST API. A MySQL database
which uses Connector/Python feeds content for the blog and collects
messages sent via the contact section's form.

I'm using [IBM Carbon Design System's](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/icons/library/)
icons. I am a great fan of Carbon and I believe that their icons
fit the overall hard-cornered vibe of y portfolio.

For the fonts i decided to go with PlayFair Display for
big titles and Open Sans for longer form text.
I also decided to use two variants of my favourite font - IBM Plex
for the interactive elements. IBM Plex Sans is used for buttons
and IBM Plex Mono - for the blog post tags that you can push
in order to search for posts with the same tags.
IBM Plex Sans sometimes coexists with Carbon icons and they look
well together.
